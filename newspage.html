<b>November 25th, 2020</b><br><br>
<br>I am writing to inform anyone who still follows this page that the GitHub website and my email will reopen for download inquiries, as well as limited support as of Friday, November 27th, 2020.
<br>To minimize stress, inquiries for paid buses will be processed on Thursdays, and buses will be mailed out on Fridays.
<br>
<br>No new content will be released. 
<br>
<br>If you have questions, feel free to send me an email at <mailto:xen44324434@gmail.com>.

<b>January 1st, 2020</b><br><br>
<br>In light of some new developments, I have decided to curtail all upcoming dates. <b>Monday, January 6th, 2020 (previously Wednesday, January 15th)</b> will be the last day to download or request new copies of available buses. Additionally, there may be an update for the Gillig Advantage before this date. If nothing is uploaded by that date, then it is not coming out. By <b> Friday, January 17th, 2020 (previously Friday, January 31st, 2020)</b> the GitHub site and the Facebook page will either be deactivated (meaning that I won’t interact with this page at all, and messages will be turned off) and/or dissolved completely.
<br>
<br>

    <p align=left>
<br>
<b>January 1st, 2020</b><br><br>
<br>I have closed my Discord server, and the New Flyer HF Series is no longer available for purchase. This also means that the NABI 416/436 will not be released. <b>January 15th, 2020</b> will be the last day to download or request new copies of available buses. Additionally, there may be an update for the Gillig Advantage before this date. If nothing is uploaded by that date, then it is not coming out. By <b>January 31st, 2020</b> the GitHub site and the Facebook page will either be deactivated (meaning that I won’t interact with this page at all, and messages will be turned off) and/or dissolved completely.

<br>
<b>December 12th, 2019</b><br><br>
<br> • Just as a heads-up,
<br>January 1st will be the last day to purchase any vehicles available currently or in the future, and
<br>January 15th will be the last day to download or request new copies of available buses.
<br>
<br>By January 31st, the GitHub page, the Discord server, and this page will either be deactivated (meaning that I won’t interact with this page at all, and messages will be turned off) and/or dissolved completely.
<br>
<br>Some have suggested that I reupload current vehicles to sites such as OMSI Webdisk. I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that I will not be re-uploading any vehicles anywhere. Whatever is reuploaded by 3rd parties after those dates is at their own discretion. I am no longer interested in getting into any petty crusades about anything OMSI-related.
<br>
<br>A final decision has yet to be made about the 416/436, but just know that whatever outcome will be subject to these same deadlines.

<br> • As of September 20th, 2019, the Gillig Phantom will no longer be available for purchase. I don’t want to devote any more time to making sure people have their copies.<br>People who bought the bus are welcome to fill out the Previously Paid Buses form, but the time period in which you may receive a new bus will expand significantly (previously 24hrs, now a week).

<b>August 16th, 2019</b><br><br>
<br> • I'm planning on releasing an update for the HF series buses on Saturday, August 17th.
<br>This update will include minor fixes for the template, as well as some sounds and scripts, and will likely be the last for a little while.
<br>This is being done so that I can work on other (public) buses I want to update before school starts. 
<br>If you have any suggestions for stuff I could fix before then, now's the time cuz after Saturday, I'm moving onto other things.
<br>Changelogs for the upcoming update can be provided upon request.
